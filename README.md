RosettaStone is Hearthstone simulator using C++ with some reinforcement learning. The code is built on C++17 and can be compiled with commonly available compilers such as g++, clang++, or Microsoft Visual Studio. RosettaStone currently supports macOS (10.14 or later), Ubuntu (18.04 or later), Windows (Visual Studio 2017 or later), and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Other untested platforms that support C++17 also should be able to build RosettaStone.

## Implementation List

  * [Ability list](./Documents/AbilityList.md)
  * [Card list](./Documents/CardList.md)
  * [Task list](./Documents/TaskList.md)

## Quick Start

You will need CMake to build the code. If you're using Windows, you need Visual Studio 2017 in addition to CMake.

First, clone the code:

```
git clone https://github.com/utilForever/RosettaStone.git --recursive
cd RosettaStone
```

### Python API

Build and install the packagae by running

```
pip install -U .
```

**NOTE**: We are making Python API and related examples.

### C++ API

For macOS or Linux or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

For Windows:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"
MSBuild RosettaStone.sln /p:Configuration=Release
```

Now run console simulator:

```
bin/RosettaConsole
```

**NOTE**: To run GUI simulator, please check out [RosettaStone GUI](https://www.github.com/utilforever/RosettaStone-GUI).

### Docker

```
docker pull utilforever/rosettastone:latest
```

Now run console simulator:

```
docker run -it utilforever/rosettastone
[inside docker container]
/app/build/bin/RosettaConsole
```

### More Instructions of Building the Code
